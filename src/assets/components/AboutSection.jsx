        I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in front-end
        development (React.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind). I am very enthusiastic about bringing
        the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User
        experience, pixel-perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly
        performant code matters to me.
